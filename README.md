# zeb
In the short term, this project is a testbed for the idea to let no-coding-experience people to make a website with easy and fun, like children build their imaginary world with toy building blocks.
The longer term future of the code in this repository will become clearer after a few months of progress. For now, our goal primary goal is to iterate rapidly and learn as much as possible.

## Foundational priorities
Our goal is to build a cross-platform web site generator for fun that is designed from the beginning around the following foundational priorities:
### Web to Web
You edit your page in a platform based on web technology and the result is a web site.

### Component Based
Your page is made up of components.

### Responsive or Grid ?

## Architecture

## Development Process
> Experiment, Documentation-driven, Test-driven...

### Q2 2018 RoadMap (2018.4.1-2018.6.31)
Zeb is a desktop app. We choose Electron as our develop platform. And, we decide to use canvas to do our main rendering part. In April, we will do some research about canvas and electron. After gaining enough basic knowledge about both, we will define the basic rules of zeb. We also to plan to build our basic scaffolad for later development and release. And we may find some ways to add test and ci when make our settings.
 - [ ] Define Basic Functions and UI Layout
   - [ ] Canvas Research
   - [ ] Electron Research
   - [ ] Define Basic Architecture
 - [ ] Scaffoald Dev Environment
   - [ ] Webpack or so
   - [ ] Unit Test and Auto Test
   - [ ] Github CI
 
### Q3 2018 RoadMap (2018.7.1-2018.9.31)
We'd like to implement the generate part.
By the end of this quarter, zeb should be usable. We will release v0.1.0.
 - [ ] Generate Page
 - [ ] Release and Auto Update

### Q4 2018 RoadMap (2018.10.1-2018.12.31)
By the time the basic functions are realized, the Data Storage part is the next milestone.
We should decide where and how these data are stored.

This list is incomplete and will likey evolve as this time approaches.
